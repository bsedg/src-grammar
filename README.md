# src-grammar
==============

Source code grammars can provide tools to test for the conformity and nonconformity of expected source code format and structure.  

Key tools are used:

 * [srcML](http://www.srcml.org/) - A document-oriented XML representation of source code
 * [RelaxNG](http://relaxng.org/) - A simple schema language for XML

## Source

Works derived from building up core elements from testing.  Complete source code files are created from including core RelaxNG files.  

## Testing

Test files are located in the /test directory.  

### Git

Clone the latest code from git:

      git clone git://github.com/bsedg/src-grammar.git
